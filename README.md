This project marked my first foray into Next.js development. Despite having prior experience with React projects, I was particularly impressed by the capabilities of Next.js, which significantly simplified server-side tasks.

During the development process, I faced a few hurdles. Although Next.js provides the useRouter component for easy routing, I initially struggled with its implementation and had to refer back to the documentation for guidance.

My main goal in undertaking this project was to gain a better grasp of server-side functionality. To speed up frontend development, I decided to use Material Tailwind. I drew inspiration from a tutorial on YouTube by HuXnWebdev, which motivated me to dive into this project for learning and exploration.
